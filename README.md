### Important
* Please always run lint before pushing to a branch. We cant setup ci/cd jobs to check before merging automatically because school hasn't setup any runners.

### Requirements
* gcc-avr
* binutils-avr
* avr-libc
* avrdude
* make
* cmake
* python
* pip
* cpplint
* doxygen

### Running lint
1. Make sure you have python and pip installed (`sudo apt install python3`) & (`sudo apt install pip`)
2. Make sure you have pip installed (`pip install cpplint`)
3. To make sure cpplint is working you can run `cpplint --help` if it's not working you might need to reboot your system
4. Run `chmod +x ./cpplint.sh` to make the file executable
5. Run `cpplint.sh`

### Running doxygen
1. Make sure you have installed doxygen (`sudo apt install doxygen`)
2. Run doxygen doxygen-config in the root of the project
3. If you get a dot error running doxygen you might need to install graphviz (`sudo apt install graphviz`)
4. The generated doxygen files cna be found in the html folder
